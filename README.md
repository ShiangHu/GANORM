## Installation
The code requires `matlab enviroment`. You should download GANORM [here]([https:](https://github.com/xiaolonghuang09/GANORM)) and install in matlab.

Install GANORM
```
git clone https://github.com/xiaolonghuang09/GANORM
```

Add `GANORM` directory into your matlab 
```
cd addpath(genpath("GANORM"))
```

## Data Download
* MNCS

## Quick Start
* Data gather
  Prior to running the code, it is necessary to preprocess the data and extract the required information.You can run `gather_data.m` to get predata.
* Data Analysis
  You can execute the `main.m` script to obtain all the analysis results.
  You can also run a specific function to obtain the desired results.
  * You can obtain the evolutionary trajectory of brain networks within the alpha band by running `alpha_network.m`.
  * You can obtain the evolutionary trajectory of network characteristics by running `all_people_feature.m`.
  * You can train a BPNN model by running `BPNN.m`.
  * You can perform cross-site validation by running `crosscite_validation.m`.
